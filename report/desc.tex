\chapter{Problem description}

The Gram-Schmidt's algorithm is used in algebra to orthonormalise a set of vectors in an inner product space. It takes a finite and linearly independant set of vectors $S$ and returns an orthogonal set of vector $S'$.\\

This algorithm requires a lot of computations and can take quite a long time to complete.\\

Therefore, in this assignment, we are to parallelize the Gram-Schmidt's algorithm using OpenMP.
