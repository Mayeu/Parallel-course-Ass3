\subsection{Parallelization using the \textit{for} directive}

The Openmp data obtained lead to the same conclusion as the last report: the overhead have to be carefully handled to assure a good use of the processor time.\\

Since we had already data for the pthread implementation of gram, we have compared the data of openmp with the one we get during the pthread lab. Taking pthread has a reference we draw the graph \ref{fig:gram_pthread} page \pageref{fig:gram_pthread}. Which represent the relative speedup of OpenMP with pthread data as reference.

We see that the OpenMP implementation is equivalent to the pthread one.
(if we do not consider matrices of $10\times 10$ wich are not really relevent du to the massive overhead).
